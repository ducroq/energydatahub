## Context

### Problem Statement

The energyDataHub collects day-ahead electricity prices from ENTSO-E for the Netherlands market. To predict prices 2-7 days ahead (Model A), we need weather forecasts that capture the primary drivers of European electricity prices.

### Key Insight: Why Multi-Location Weather Matters

European electricity markets are highly interconnected through **market coupling**. Dutch prices are not determined solely by Dutch weather, but by:

1. **Renewable generation across coupled markets** (primarily Germany)
2. **Cross-border electricity flows** (when German wind is high, prices drop across NL/BE/DE)
3. **Regional demand patterns** (temperature drives heating/cooling load)

**Local Arnhem weather alone is insufficient** for predicting pan-European market prices.

### Price Formation Drivers (Merit Order)

Electricity is dispatched in order of marginal cost:

1. **Renewables** (wind/solar) → €0-5/MWh (fuel cost = zero)
2. **Nuclear** → €10-20/MWh (inflexible baseload)
3. **Hydro** → Variable (opportunity cost)
4. **Gas** → €50-150/MWh (flexible, sets price most hours)
5. **Coal** → €80-200/MWh (backup)

**Key Takeaway**: High renewable generation → displaces gas → prices drop dramatically.

### Renewable Capacity by Country (2024)

| Country | Wind (GW) | Solar (GW) | Impact on NL Prices |
|---------|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| **Germany** | 70 | 80 | ⭐⭐⭐ Highest (market leader) |
| **Netherlands** | 8 | 20 | ⭐⭐ Direct (our market) |
| **Belgium** | 5 | 8 | ⭐⭐ High (coupled) |
| **Denmark** | 7 | 2 | ⭐ Medium (wind exports) |
| **France** | 22 | 16 | ⭐ Medium (nuclear-dominant) |
| **UK** | 28 | 15 | ⭐ Low (weak coupling) |

**Germany dominates** with ~150 GW renewables → German weather is critical for NL price prediction!

## Strategic Location Selection

### Selection Criteria

Locations were chosen based on:

1. **Renewable capacity** (GW wind/solar in region)
2. **Market coupling strength** (interconnector capacity to NL)
3. **Weather diversity** (capture different wind/solar patterns)
4. **Geographic spread** (North Sea wind vs. Continental solar)

### Tier 1: Essential Locations (6 locations)

These locations capture >80% of weather-driven price variance:

#### 🇩🇪 Germany (2 locations) - Most Important

**1. Hamburg, Germany**
- **Coordinates**: 53.5511°N, 9.9937°E

## Feature Engineering from Multi-Location Data

### Raw Weather Features (per location × 6 locations)

- Temperature (°C)
- Wind speed (m/s)
- Wind direction (°)
- Cloud cover (%)
- Solar irradiance (W/m²) - computed from cloud cover + sun angle
- Precipitation (mm)
- Pressure (hPa)

**Total**: 7 features × 6 locations = 42 raw features

### Aggregate Features (derived)

**Wind Power Proxy Features:**
```python
# Wind power scales with wind_speed³
wind_power_proxy_north_sea = mean([
    wind_speed_hamburg³,
    wind_speed_ijmuiden³,
    wind_speed_esbjerg³
])

wind_power_proxy_germany = mean([
    wind_speed_hamburg³,
    wind_speed_munich³
])
```

**Solar Power Proxy Features:**
```python
# Solar power depends on irradiance (cloud cover + sun angle)
solar_power_proxy_germany = mean([
    solar_irradiance_munich,
    solar_irradiance_arnhem
])
```

**Temperature-Driven Demand:**
```python
# Heating demand (winter): low temp → high demand → high prices
heating_demand_proxy = mean([
    max(0, 18 - temp_hamburg),
    max(0, 18 - temp_arnhem),
    max(0, 18 - temp_brussels)
])

# Cooling demand (summer): high temp → high demand → high prices
cooling_demand_proxy = mean([
    max(0, temp_munich - 25),
    max(0, temp_arnhem - 25)
])
```

**Weather Gradients (cross-border flow indicators):**
```python
# Pressure gradient → wind direction → flow direction
pressure_gradient_de_nl = pressure_hamburg - pressure_arnhem

# Wind gradient → generation imbalance → price arbitrage
wind_gradient_de_nl = wind_speed_hamburg - wind_speed_arnhem

# Temperature gradient → demand imbalance
temp_gradient_north_south = temp_hamburg - temp_munich
```

**Temporal Features:**
```python
# Predictable patterns
hour_of_day           # 0-23 (solar during day, demand peaks morning/evening)
day_of_week          # 1-7 (weekday vs. weekend demand)
month                # 1-12 (seasonal patterns)
is_holiday           # 0/1 (low demand on holidays)
season               # winter/spring/summer/autumn
```

**Lagged Price Features (autoregressive):**
```python
# Historical prices predict future prices
price_lag_24h        # Same hour yesterday
price_lag_168h       # Same hour last week
price_rolling_mean_24h
price_rolling_std_24h
```

### Feature Importance Hypothesis

**Expected order of importance** (to be validated by model):

1. **German wind power proxy** (Hamburg) - Highest impact
2. **Hour of day** - Solar generation timing
3. **Temperature (heating/cooling demand)** - Seasonal
4. **Dutch wind power proxy** (IJmuiden) - Local market
5. **German solar power proxy** (Munich) - Summer midday
6. **Historical prices (lags)** - Autoregressive component
7. **Pressure gradients** - Weather system movement
8. **Day of week** - Demand patterns

## Data Collection Strategy

### Implementation Approach

**Dual-API Strategy for Weather Collection:**

We use two complementary weather APIs:

1. **Google Weather API** - For strategic onshore locations
   - **API**: Google Weather API (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/weather)
   - **Forecast horizon**: 240 hours (10 days)
   - **Locations**: 15 strategic onshore locations (major cities, renewable hubs)
   - **Limitation**: Does not support open-sea coordinates (returns 404 errors)

2. **Open-Meteo API** - For offshore wind farm locations
   - **API**: Open-Meteo API (https://open-meteo.com/en/docs)
   - **Forecast horizon**: 10 days
   - **Locations**: 9 actual offshore wind farm coordinates
   - **Advantage**: Global ICON/GFS models work for any coordinate including offshore
   - **Cost**: FREE (no API key required)
   - **Wind heights**: 10m, 80m, 120m, 180m (matches turbine hub heights)

### Why Two APIs?

Google Weather API provides excellent forecasts for land-based locations but returns 404 errors for open-sea coordinates. Since offshore wind farms are located 20-50km offshore, we need Open-Meteo's global models which support any coordinate worldwide.

**Benefits of Open-Meteo for Offshore:**
- Actual offshore coordinates (not coastal proxies)
- Multi-height wind data (80m, 120m, 180m for turbine hub heights)
- Air density calculation (affects power output)
- Wind gusts (important for turbine safety)
- Free with no API key required
- Historical data available since 1940 (for backfilling)

### Parallel with Existing Data

**Keep existing collectors for:**

1. **OpenWeather (Arnhem)** - Backup + validation
2. **MeteoServer (Arnhem)** - Dutch HARMONIE model (high local accuracy)
3. **Google Weather (6 locations)** - Pan-European coverage

This redundancy allows:
- Model comparison (single-location vs. multi-location)
- Fallback if one API fails
- Validation of Google Weather quality

### Storage Format

Store multi-location weather as:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "generated_at": "2025-01-04T16:30:00Z",
    "source": "google_weather_api",
    "forecast_horizon_hours": 240,
    "locations_count": 6
  },
  "datasets": [
    {
      "name": "weather_forecast_multi_location",
      "locations": [
        {
          "name": "Hamburg_DE",
          "latitude": 53.5511,
          "longitude": 9.9937,

              "cloud_cover": 75,
              "pressure": 1013,
              "humidity": 82,
              "precipitation": 0.0
            },
            ...
          ]
        },
        ...
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Model A Integration

### Training Data Requirements

**Minimum dataset for initial model:**
- **6 months historical data** (captures seasonal variation)
- **Hourly granularity** (6 months × 720 hours/month = 4,320 samples)
- **Features**: ~50-100 (raw + derived + temporal + lags)
- **Target**: Hourly electricity price (EUR/MWh)

**Data sources to combine:**
1. Historical ENTSO-E prices (target variable) - ✅ Already collecting
2. Historical weather (6 locations) - ⚠️ Need to start collecting now
3. Historical local generation (for Model B) - ⚠️ Future work

### Model Architecture

**Baseline models:**
- Persistence (tomorrow = today)
- Seasonal naive (tomorrow = last week)
- Linear regression (weather features → price)

**Advanced models:**
- SARIMAX (seasonal ARIMA with weather exogenous variables)
- Random Forest / Gradient Boosting (capture non-linear interactions)
- LSTM / Temporal CNN (if >1 year data available)

**Ensemble:**
- Weighted average of top 3 models
- Uncertainty quantification via ensemble spread

---

## Success Metrics

### Model Performance Targets

**Technical accuracy:**
- MAE < 10 EUR/MWh for 24h ahead predictions
- MAE < 15 EUR/MWh for 72h ahead predictions
- MAE < 20 EUR/MWh for 168h ahead predictions
- Directional accuracy > 70% (predict up/down correctly)

**Business value:**
- Cost reduction vs. baseline scheduling: >10%
- Electrolyzer run-time optimization: >5% efficiency gain

### Validation Strategy

**Walk-forward validation:**
- Train on months 1-6
- Validate on month 7
- Roll forward weekly
- Retrain monthly

**Comparison tests:**
1. **Single-location (Arnhem only)** vs. **Multi-location (6 locations)**
   - Hypothesis: Multi-location improves MAE by 15-25%
2. **Weather-based model** vs. **Persistence baseline**
   - Hypothesis: Weather features provide 30-40% error reduction
3. **Short-term (24h)** vs. **Long-term (168h)** accuracy
   - Hypothesis: MAE doubles from 24h to 168h

---

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Google Weather API Quality Unknown

**Mitigation:**
- Collect in parallel with OpenWeather/MeteoServer (first 3 months)
- Compare forecast accuracy against actual weather
- Validate against historical reanalysis (ERA5)
- Switch provider if quality insufficient

### Risk 2: 6 Locations May Be Insufficient

**Mitigation:**
- Start with Tier 1 (6 locations)
- Monitor model residuals (where does it fail?)
- Add Tier 2 locations if specific gaps identified
- Maximum cost still trivial (<400 calls/month = $0.06/month)

### Risk 3: Weather-Price Relationship Complex

**Mitigation:**
- Use non-linear models (Random Forest, Neural Networks)
- Feature engineering (wind³, temperature gradients)
- Include autoregressive features (past prices)
- Ensemble multiple model types

### Risk 4: 6 Months Collection Delay

**Mitigation:**
- Start collecting immediately (don't wait for Model A repo setup)
- Use historical weather data if available (ERA5, ECMWF archives)
- Build Model A architecture in parallel during collection period
- Train on shorter dataset (3 months) for initial validation

## Offshore Wind Farm Locations

### Dedicated Offshore Wind Collector

In addition to the strategic onshore locations, we collect wind data at **actual offshore wind farm coordinates** using Open-Meteo's global weather models.

### Offshore Wind Locations (9 locations)

| Location | Country | Coordinates | Capacity | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------------|----------|-------|
| Borssele | 🇳🇱 NL | 51.7000°N, 3.0000°E | 1.5 GW | Southern Dutch North Sea |
| Hollandse Kust | 🇳🇱 NL | 52.5000°N, 4.2000°E | 3.5 GW | Off IJmuiden coast |
| Gemini | 🇳🇱 NL | 54.0361°N, 5.9625°E | 600 MW | Northern Dutch waters |
| IJmuiden Ver | 🇳🇱 NL | 52.8500°N, 3.5000°E | 4 GW | Planned mega-project |
| Helgoland Cluster | 🇩🇪 DE | 54.2000°N, 7.5000°E | Multi-GW | German Bight cluster |
| Borkum Riffgrund | 🇩🇪 DE | 53.9667°N, 6.5500°E | 1+ GW | Near Borkum island |
| Dogger Bank | 🇬🇧 UK | 54.7500°N, 2.5000°E | 3.6 GW | World's largest offshore wind farm |
| Horns Rev | 🇩🇰 DK | 55.4833°N, 7.8500°E | 1+ GW | Danish North Sea |
| North Sea BE | 🇧🇪 BE | 51.5833°N, 2.8000°E | 2+ GW | Belgian offshore cluster |

### Offshore Wind Variables Collected

| Variable | Unit | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `wind_speed_10m` | m/s | Surface wind speed |
| `wind_speed_80m` | m/s | Near hub height (small turbines) |
| `wind_speed_120m` | m/s | Hub height for large turbines |
| `wind_speed_180m` | m/s | Top of rotor sweep |
| `wind_direction_*` | degrees | Direction at each height (0°=N, 90°=E) |
| `wind_gusts_10m` | m/s | Wind gusts (turbine safety) |
| `temperature` | °C | Air temperature |
| `pressure` | hPa | Surface pressure |
| `air_density` | kg/m³ | Calculated from temp & pressure |

### Why Multi-Height Wind Data Matters

Wind power is proportional to wind speed cubed (P ∝ v³). Modern offshore turbines have:
- **Hub height**: 100-150m above sea level
- **Rotor diameter**: 150-220m
- **Rotor sweep**: from ~30m to ~260m above sea level

By collecting wind at 80m, 120m, and 180m, we can:
1. Estimate wind shear (speed variation with height)
2. Calculate rotor-averaged wind speed
3. More accurately predict power output

### Air Density Calculation

Wind power also depends on air density: P = ½ρAv³

Air density is calculated from temperature and pressure:
```
ρ = P / (R × T)
where:
  P = pressure in Pa
  R = 287.05 J/(kg·K) (gas constant for air)
  T = temperature in Kelvin
```

Cold, high-pressure days produce more power from the same wind speed.
